#Feedreader Testing Project

This is the Feedreader Testing Project. This project uses [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) to test the provided feedreader application.
Testing is done through a number of __test suites__(conditions that must be passed)
to ensure that the application will maintain functionality as the code is developed.

___

###Running the Application

This application is run by opening `index.html` in a browser with an internet
connection. The tests that are run are displayed at the bottom of the page.
Users can see which __specs__(the test suites) have been run, and which ones
have passed. Green indicates that specs have passed, while red indicates failure.
The test suites are found within the `feedreader.js` file. The file that is being
tested is `app.js`, which contains the code for the application's functionality.
